@article{Tanter2000,
abstract = {To focus ultrasonic waves in an unknown inhomogeneous medium using a phased array, one has to calculate the optimal set of signals to be applied on the transducers of the array. In the case of time-reversal mirrors, one assumes that a source is available at the focus, providing the Green's function of this point. In this paper, the robustness of this time-reversal method is investigated when loss of information breaks the time-reversal invariance. It arises in dissipative media or when the field radiated by the source is not entirely measured by the limited aperture of a time-reversal mirror. However, in both cases, linearity and reciprocity relations ensure time reversal to achieve a spatiotemporal matched filtering. Nevertheless, though it provides robustness to this method, no constraints are imposed on the field out of the focus and sidelobes may appear. Another approach consists of measuring the Green's functions associated to the focus but also to neighboring points. Thus, the whole information characterizing the medium is known and the inverse source problem can be solved. A matrix formalism of the propagation operator is introduced to compare the time-reversal and inverse filter techniques. Moreover, experiments investigated in various media are presented to illustrate this comparison.},

@article{Lewicki2000,
abstract = {In an overcomplete basis, the number of basis vectors is greater than the dimensionality of the input, and the representation of an input is not a unique combination of basis vectors. Overcomplete representations have been advocated because they have greater robustness in the presence of noise, can be sparser, and can have greater flexibility in matching structure in the data. Overcomplete codes have also been proposed as a model of some of the response properties of neurons in primary visual cortex. Previous work has focused on finding the best representation of a signal using a fixed overcomplete basis (or dictionary). We present an algorithm for learning an overcomplete basis by viewing it as probabilistic model of the observed data. We show that overcomplete bases can yield a better approximation of the underlying statistical distribution of the data and can thus lead to greater coding efficiency. This can be viewed as a generalization of the technique of independent component analysis and provides a method for Bayesian reconstruction of signals in the presence of noise and for blind source separation when there are more sources than mixtures.},

@article{Wang2004,
abstract = {Objective methods for assessing perceptual image quality traditionally attempted to quantify the visibility of errors (differences) between a distorted image and a reference image using a variety of known properties of the human visual system. Under the assumption that human visual perception is highly adapted for extracting structural information from a scene, we introduce an alternative complementary framework for quality assessment based on the degradation of structural information. As a specific example of this concept, we develop a Structural Similarity Index and demonstrate its promise through a set of intuitive examples, as well as comparison to both subjective ratings and state-of-the-art objective methods on a database of images compressed with JPEG and JPEG2000.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of computing the k-sparse approximation to the discrete Fourier transform of an n-dimensional signal. We show: * An O(k log n)-time randomized algorithm for the case where the input signal has at most k non-zero Fourier coefficients, and * An O(k log n log(n/k))-time randomized algorithm for general input signals. Both algorithms achieve o(n log n) time, and thus improve over the Fast Fourier Transform, for any k = o(n). They are the first known algorithms that satisfy this property. Also, if one assumes that the Fast Fourier Transform is optimal, the algorithm for the exactly k-sparse case is optimal for any k = n\^{}\{$\backslash$Omega(1)\}. We complement our algorithmic results by showing that any algorithm for computing the sparse Fourier transform of a general signal must use at least $\backslash$Omega(k log(n/k)/ log log n) signal samples, even if it is allowed to perform adaptive sampling.},

abstract = {Compressed sensing aims to undersample certain high-dimensional signals yet accurately reconstruct them by exploiting signal characteristics. Accurate reconstruction is possible when the object to be recovered is sufficiently sparse in a known basis. Currently, the best known sparsity-undersampling tradeoff is achieved when reconstructing by convex optimization, which is expensive in important large-scale applications. Fast iterative thresholding algorithms have been intensively studied as alternatives to convex optimization for large-scale problems. Unfortunately known fast algorithms offer substantially worse sparsity-undersampling tradeoffs than convex optimization. We introduce a simple costless modification to iterative thresholding making the sparsity-undersampling tradeoff of the new algorithms equivalent to that of the corresponding convex optimization procedures. The new iterative-thresholding algorithms are inspired by belief propagation in graphical models. Our empirical measurements of the sparsity-undersampling tradeoff for the new algorithms agree with theoretical calculations. We show that a state evolution formalism correctly derives the true sparsity-undersampling tradeoff. There is a surprising agreement between earlier calculations based on random convex polytopes and this apparently very different theoretical formalism.},

abstract = {Low-rank matrix approximations, such as the truncated singular value decomposition and the rank-revealing QR decomposition, play a central role in data analysis and scientific computing. This work surveys and extends recent research which demonstrates that randomization offers a powerful tool for performing low-rank matrix approximation. These techniques exploit modern computational architectures more fully than classical methods and open the possibility of dealing with truly massive data sets. This paper presents a modular framework for constructing randomized algorithms that compute partial matrix decompositions. These methods use random sampling to identify a subspace that captures most of the action of a matrix. The input matrix is then compressed---either explicitly or implicitly---to this subspace, and the reduced matrix is manipulated deterministically to obtain the desired low-rank factorization. In many cases, this approach beats its classical competitors in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness. These claims are supported by extensive numerical experiments and a detailed error analysis.},

This setting can accommodate regularization constraints on the factors through Bayesian priors. In particular, inverse-gamma and gamma Markov chain priors are considered in this work. Estimation can be carried out using a space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm; this leads to a novel type of NMF algorithm, whose convergence to a stationary point of the IS cost function is guaranteed. We also discuss the links between the IS divergence and other cost functions used in NMF, in particular, the Euclidean distance and the generalized Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. As such, we describe how IS-NMF can also be performed using a gradient multiplicative algorithm (a standard algorithm structure in NMF) whose convergence is observed in practice, though not proven. Finally, we report a furnished experimental comparative study of Euclidean-NMF, KL-NMF, and IS-NMF algorithms applied to the power spectrogram of a short piano sequence recorded in real conditions, with various initializations and model orders. Then we show how IS-NMF can successfully be employed for denoising and upmix (mono to stereo conversion) of an original piece of early jazz music. These experiments indicate that IS-NMF correctly captures the semantics of audio and is better suited to the representation of music signals than NMF with the usual Euclidean and KL costs.},

@article{Olshausen1996,
abstract = {The receptive fields of simple cells in mammalian primary visual cortex
can be characterized as being spatially localized, oriented and bandpass
(selective to structure at different spatial scales), comparable
to the basis functions of wavelet transforms. One approach to understanding
such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their
relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms
of efficient coding. Along these lines, a number of studies have
attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images
in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties,
but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image
space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate
the proposal that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is
sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning
algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes
will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive
fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The
resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation
for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree
of statistical independence among its outputs.},

@article{Viberg2004,
abstract = {The cochleogram is commonly used for illustrating hair cell loss after insult, yet standardized procedures for plotting either individual or averaged cochleograms are lacking despite more than 40 years of use. Due to the intra-species variation in basilar membrane (BM) length, it is important that length is plotted on the cochleogram in percent and not millimeter. It is also of interest to correlate the location of lesion to frequency by using a frequency-place equation. However, there is no consensus as which equation is most suitable for the species under study. This is an important issue since two different equations can result in significantly different frequency-place maps for the same cochlea. The purpose of this presentation is to suggest procedures for standardizing the cochleogram. The guidelines include: (i) basilar membrane length should be plotted as percent instead of millimeter due to the biological variation that exists in BM length within a particular species and strain, and the total length in millimeter stated on the cochleogram; (ii) the equations used for frequency-place maps should be stated on the cochleogram; (iii) different basilar membrane lengths should be normalized to percent before averaged cochleograms are made. These procedures are illustrated and discussed.},

@techreport{Baron2009,
abstract = {Compressive sensing is a signal acquisition framework based on the revelation that a small collection of linear projections of a sparse signal contains enough information for stable recovery. In this paper we introduce a new theory for distributed compressive sensing (DCS) that enables new distributed coding algorithms for multi-signal ensembles that exploit both intra- and inter-signal correlation structures. The DCS theory rests on a new concept that we term the joint sparsity of a signal ensemble. Our theoretical contribution is to characterize the fundamental performance limits of DCS recovery for jointly sparse signal ensembles in the noiseless measurement setting; our result connects single-signal, joint, and distributed (multi-encoder) compressive sensing. To demonstrate the efficacy of our framework and to show that additional challenges such as computational tractability can be addressed, we study in detail three example models for jointly sparse signals. For these models, we develop practical algorithms for joint recovery of multiple signals from incoherent projections. In two of our three models, the results are asymptotically best-possible, meaning that both the upper and lower bounds match the performance of our practical algorithms. Moreover, simulations indicate that the asymptotics take effect with just a moderate number of signals. DCS is immediately applicable to a range of problems in sensor arrays and networks.},

abstract = {Matching pursuit (MP), a new technique of time-frequency signal analysis, was applied to simulated signals and the awake and sleep EEG. With the MP algorithm, waveforms from a very large class of functions were fitted to the local signal structures in a recursive procedure. By means of this technique, sleep spindles were localized in the time-frequency plane with high precision, and their intensities and time spans were found. The MP technique makes following the temporal evolution of transients and their propagation in brains possible. It opens up new possibilities in EEG research providing a means of investigation of dynamic processes in brains in a much finer time-frequency scale than any other method available at present.},

@article{Pressnitzer2008a,
abstract = {Segmenting the complex acoustic mixture that makes a typical auditory scene into relevant perceptual objects is one of the main challenges of the auditory system [1], for both human and nonhuman species. Several recent studies indicate that perceptual auditory object formation, or "streaming," may be based on neural activity within the auditory cortex and beyond [2, 3]. Here, we find that scene analysis starts much earlier in the auditory pathways. Single units were recorded from a peripheral structure of the mammalian auditory brainstem, the cochlear nucleus. Peripheral responses were similar to cortical responses and displayed all of the functional properties required for streaming, including multisecond adaptation. Behavioral streaming was also measured in human listeners. Neurometric functions derived from the peripheral responses predicted accurately behavioral streaming. This reveals that subcortical structures may already contribute to the analysis of auditory scenes. This finding is consistent with the observation that species lacking a neocortex can still achieve and benefit from behavioral streaming [4]. For humans, we argue that auditory scene analysis of complex scenes is probably based on interactions between subcortical and cortical neural processes, with the relative contribution of each stage depending on the nature of the acoustic cues forming the streams.},

abstract = {A unified approach to multiterminal source coding problems not involving rate-distortion theory is presented. It is shown that, for determining file achievable rate region, attention may be restricted to source networks of a relatively simple structure. A product space characterizafion of the achievable rate region pinpoints the mathematical problem to be solved for getting a single letter characterization. The complexity of this problem depends on a structural condition, viz., the number of encoders of a certain kind in the source network. This approach yields all the known single-letter characterizations of achievable rate regions and a number of new ones for more complex networks. As a digression, for a class of source networks including that of Slepian and Wolf, exponential error bounds are derived which are attainable by universal codes. These bounds are tight in a neighborhood of the boundary of the achievable rate region.},

Unlike other binarization schemes, this framework allows, up to a scaling factor, the explicit reconstruction from the binary representation of the original vector. The paper also shows that random projections which are used in Locality Sensitive Hashing algorithms, are significantly outperformed by regular frames for both synthetic and real data if the number of bits exceeds the vector dimensionality, i.e., when high precision is required.},

@article{FiguerasiVentura2006,
abstract = {New breakthroughs in image coding possibly lie in signal decomposition through nonseparable basis functions that can efficiently capture edge characteristics, present in natural images. The work proposed in this paper provides an adaptive way of representing images as a sum of two-dimensional features. It presents a low bit-rate image coding method based on a matching pursuit (MP) expansion, over a dictionary built on anisotropic refinement and rotation of contour-like atoms. This method is shown to provide, at low bit rates, results comparable to the state of the art in image compression, represented here by JPEG2000 and SPIHT, with generally a better visual quality in the MP scheme. The coding artifacts are less annoying than the ringing introduced by wavelets at very low bit rate, due to the smoothing performed by the basis functions used in the MP algorithm. In addition to good compression performances at low bit rates, the new coder has the advantage of producing highly flexible streams. They can easily be decoded at any spatial resolution, different from the original image, and the bitstream can be truncated at any point to match diverse bandwidth requirements. The spatial adaptivity is shown to be more flexible and less complex than transcoding operations generally applied to state of the art codec bitstreams. Due to both its ability for capturing the most important parts of multidimensional signals, and a flexible stream structure, the image coder proposed in this paper represents an interesting solution for low to medium rate image coding in visual communication applications.},

abstract = {The auditory neural code must serve a wide range of auditory tasks that require great sensitivity in time and frequency and be effective over the diverse array of sounds present in natural acoustic environments. It has been suggested that sensory systems might have evolved highly efficient coding strategies to maximize the information conveyed to the brain while minimizing the required energy and neural resources. Here we show that, for natural sounds, the complete acoustic waveform can be represented efficiently with a nonlinear model based on a population spike code. In this model, idealized spikes encode the precise temporal positions and magnitudes of underlying acoustic features. We find that when the features are optimized for coding either natural sounds or speech, they show striking similarities to time-domain cochlear filter estimates, have a frequency-bandwidth dependence similar to that of auditory nerve fibres, and yield significantly greater coding efficiency than conventional signal representations. These results indicate that the auditory code might approach an information theoretic optimum and that the acoustic structure of speech might be adapted to the coding capacity of the mammalian auditory system.},

@article{Zhang2012,
abstract = {In this paper, we show how to efficiently and effectively extract a class of "low-rank textures" in a 3D scene from 2D images despite significant corruptions and warping. The low-rank textures capture geometrically meaningful structures in an image, which encompass conventional local features such as edges and corners as well as all kinds of regular, symmetric patterns ubiquitous in urban environments and man-made objects. Our approach to finding these low-rank textures leverages the recent breakthroughs in convex optimization that enable robust recovery of a high-dimensional low-rank matrix despite gross sparse errors. In the case of planar regions with significant affine or projective deformation, our method can accurately recover both the intrinsic low-rank texture and the precise domain transformation, and hence the 3D geometry and appearance of the planar regions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that this new technique works effectively for many regular and near-regular patterns or objects that are approximately low-rank, such as symmetrical patterns, building facades, printed texts, and human faces.},

abstract = {Peak detection is ubiquitous in the analysis of spectral data. While many noise-filtering algorithms and peak identification algorithms have been developed, recent work [P. Du, W. Kibbe, and S. Lin, Bioinformatics 22, 2059 (2006); A. Wee, D. Grayden, Y. Zhu, K. Petkovic-Duran, and D. Smith, Electrophoresis 29, 4215 (2008)] has demonstrated that both of these tasks are efficiently performed through analysis of the wavelet transform of the data. In this paper, we present a wavelet-based peak detection algorithm with user-defined parameters that can be readily applied to the application of any spectral data. Particular attention is given to the algorithm's resolution of overlapping peaks. The algorithm is implemented for the analysis of powder diffraction data, and successful detection of Bragg peaks is demonstrated for both low signal-to-noise data from theta-theta diffraction of nanoparticles and combinatorial x-ray diffraction data from a composition spread thin film. These datasets have different types of background signals which are effectively removed in the wavelet-based method, and the results demonstrate that the algorithm provides a robust method for automated peak detection.},

abstract = {The block Kaczmarz method is an iterative scheme for solving overdetermined least-squares problems. At each step, the algorithm projects the current iterate onto the solution space of a subset of the constraints. This paper describes a block Kaczmarz algorithm that uses a randomized control scheme to choose the subset at each step. This algorithm is the first block Kaczmarz method with an (expected) linear rate of convergence that can be expressed in terms of the geometric properties of the matrix and its submatrices. The analysis reveals that the algorithm is most effective when it is given a good row paving of the matrix, a partition of the rows into well-conditioned blocks. The operator theory literature provides detailed information about the existence and construction of good row pavings. Together, these results yield an efficient block Kaczmarz scheme that applies to many overdetermined least-squares problem.},

@article{Strahl2008,
abstract = {Evidence that neurosensory systems use sparse signal representations as well as improved performance of signal processing algorithms using sparse signal models raised interest in sparse signal coding in the last years. For natural audio signals like speech and environmental sounds, gammatone atoms have been derived as expansion functions that generate a nearly optimal sparse signal model (Smith, E., Lewicki, M., 2006. Efficient auditory coding. Nature 439, 978-982). Furthermore, gammatone functions are established models for the human auditory filters. Thus far, a practical application of a sparse gammatone signal model has been prevented by the fact that deriving the sparsest representation is, in general, computationally intractable. In this paper, we applied an accelerated version of the matching pursuit algorithm for gammatone dictionaries allowing real-time and large data set applications. We show that a sparse signal model in general has advantages in audio coding and that a sparse gammatone signal model encodes speech more efficiently in terms of sparseness than a sparse modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) signal model. We also show that the optimal gammatone parameters derived for English speech do not match the human auditory filters, suggesting for signal processing applications to derive the parameters individually for each applied signal class instead of using psychometrically derived parameters. For brain research, it means that care should be taken with directly transferring findings of optimality for technical to biological systems.},
